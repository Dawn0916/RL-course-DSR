# Your First Agents!
Here you are going to build your first agents:
* A random acting agent
* An agent that starts random, and learns.

## The key learnings for you
* Creating an environment,
* Controlling the env.,
* Creating an agent,
* Training an agent, and
* Evaluating an agent.

## The random agent
In the case of the random, you do not create an extra entity for the agent. You can 
(and it could be interesting) but it will be an overkill! After all it is a random 
generator! You can find the instruction for the case of the random agent 
[here in local repo](./random_agent.md), or [here on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_OZ-qnZO2hYd12HGp_urXZIBQo0cHq8M?authuser=1#scrollTo=MWr_fBo5WT59)


## The learning agent
In the case of the learning agent, you will create an agent that starts random, and
learns. You can find the instruction for the case of the learning agent
[here in local repo](./learning_agent.md), or [here on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xFcXDlDce1_c4VHtGV3d06lOdvi6RGIt?authuser=1#scrollTo=rktqiU2Ec18P)
